## About
---

This will be a lengthy journey I'm sure.  With each update I'll list what has been fixed and also known issues going forward with patches.  Any checkboxes or radio buttons that have blacked out text will not be useable in any form and can't be clicked on.  These represent ideas we have but are not yet implemented in the actual program at this time.  They also don't represent everything we want to do for the randomizer just all ideas we have at the moment.  More will be added / implemented when we come up with them.

## Patch Notes of Current Build
---

### 5/4/2016 Version 0.361 Notes:



### List of changes in new build:

    Changes to the UI. 
    * Neatened things up a bit
    * You are now able to drag and drop your rom files into the program insted of having to find them
    * Fixed a bug in Puzzle mode where you could bypass bosses using the pink charge shot bubble
    * Fixed 2 bugs in Puzzle Mode that resulted in unbeatable randomizations in this mode. Fixed (hopefully for the last time)
    * Fixed 2 problems with softlocking the game while using the arm and dash capsules while using movement modifiers.
    * Puzzle Mode now has multiple difficulties to select from. There is a tool tip to help explain it.
    * Miscellaneous Changes button is now added. There are only 3 things this randomizes at the moment but this will grow as time goes on. And there is only a chance that any of those things will happen.
    * Boss I-Frames - Each boss in the game can now have unique, randomized i-frames.
    * Boss Health - Each boss can now have their own randomized health, this also means different health on sigma stage revisit fights
    * Reset button - If you selected a radio button by accident or feel you don't want to use that option, you can click this button to reset the entire program instead of reopening it manually.

Known Bugs:

    * There is still a slight problem with random stages where you get credit for beating the stage you ended up playing instead of the stage you had selected from the stage select.
    * There is a potential problem with starting health. Not quite sure what it is, but it seems to be a more rare occurrence if anything. Still be careful with it and password up.


If you find any glitches or something wrong, please leave a comment :D
