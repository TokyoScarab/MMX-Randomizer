# Mega Man X Randomzier Patch Notes

Disclaimer: This is will only work on windows computers and if you are having any problem running the program, make sure your
.NetFramework is up-to-date here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130

Make sure to check out the "Releases" option above for the most current build of the game


This will be a lengthy journey I'm sure.  With each update I'll list what has been fixed and also known issues going forward with patches.  Any checkboxes or radio buttons that have blacked out text will not be useable in any form and can't be clicked on.  These represent ideas we have but are not yet implemented in the actual program at this time.  They also don't represent everything we want to do for the randomizer just all ideas we have at the moment.  More will be added / implemented when we come up with them.


5/4/2016 Version 0.361 Notes:

Way too many changes to even really note (but I'll try). Fixed a lot of various problems and way much more in the terms of updates should be coming in the next few days. This will get you going better :D

List of changes that I can remember:
* Infinite Shots - this removes the shot limit of all weapons on screen.  Even so, there is some slight hard limiting to this.  Which honestly once you go full HAM, it's overkill / lagfest.

* Starting Health Fixes - If you use a password with your game and use that password at some point to continue your playthrough, the game will now assign you the correct amount of health instead of X's default health plus Heart Tanks.  This should also make getting hadouken in this mode possible (untested).  Also, the range of random starting health has been altered form it's original (1-16) to a range that can give you more or less health that the original game.


* Charge Time - This will completely randomize all aspects of X's charge time.  This will include, but not limited to, the time it takes to hit full charge (yellow or pink) and how long it takes for each stage of charging to happen (lemon to blue to yellow to pink).  This will not make certain types of shots happen sooner than others.  The order is fixed in the traditional way; lemon, blue, yellow, pink.  At this time, it seems impossible / very difficult to swap the order

* Puzzle Mode Fixes - Included some exceptions to what can receive weaknesses.  For the time being, hadouken is excluded from this list until I can determine it stable enough to get to add it.  Generations of Puzzle Mode should all be 100% beatable....should be.  A readme for puzzle mode will be coming soon.

* Movement In General - Added fixes to X's jumping momentum and both Drunk and Uniform modes should now randomize all aspects of X's movement (unless I find more values). 

       * Jump Height - This randomizes the max height of X's jumping.  This ranges from borderline Moon jumping to high gravity jumping (AKA baby jumps)

       * Dash Speed - This randomizes the speed of X's dash.  This is randomized independently of Uniform or Drunk mode randomizing of all other movement speeds

* Stage Design - The newest option box for settings and there will be way more to put in it as progress gets made.

       * Random Stages - The stages on the Stage Select screen will be randomized but the boss portraits will stay in their original spots (this may be an additional option in the future (hopefully)

If you find any glitches or something wrong, please leave a comment :D
