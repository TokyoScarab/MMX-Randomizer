## About
---

This will be a lengthy journey I'm sure.  With each update I'll list what has been fixed and also known issues going forward with patches.  Any checkboxes or radio buttons that have blacked out text will not be useable in any form and can't be clicked on.  These represent ideas we have but are not yet implemented in the actual program at this time.  They also don't represent everything we want to do for the randomizer just all ideas we have at the moment.  More will be added / implemented when we come up with them.

### List of changes in new build: Version 0.50 6/30/2016

 MMX Randomizer Version 0.50

@TokyoScarab TokyoScarab released this 5 minutes ago

Lots of small changes and some new features!

Random Maverick mode is here in it's beta form. This will randomize all mavs except Eagle and Mammoth, but hopefully they will cooperate in the future. Puzzle mode hasn't been tested with this yet, so expect the rare change of not being able to beat the game if you use both at the same time. Should still be a fun experience though.

Capsule animations are now turned off if you alter speed in any way. This will now prevent annoying softlocks due to animation breakage.

Roms will now generate a random file name suggestion when you go to save. You can choose to keep the name or change it. The name generation will have more added to it over time and this is just the alpha version of it.

Random health is still causing some problems, so tread lightly if you use it.


Known Bugs:
* There is still a slight problem with random stages where you get credit for beating the stage you ended up playing instead of the stage you had selected from the stage select.
* 
* There is a potential problem with starting health.  Not quite sure what it is, but it seems to be a more rare occurrence if anything.  Still be careful with it and password up.

If you find any glitches or something wrong, please leave a comment :D
