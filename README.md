## About
---

This will be a lengthy journey I'm sure.  With each update I'll list what has been fixed and also known issues going forward with patches.  Any checkboxes or radio buttons that have blacked out text will not be useable in any form and can't be clicked on.  These represent ideas we have but are not yet implemented in the actual program at this time.  They also don't represent everything we want to do for the randomizer just all ideas we have at the moment.  More will be added / implemented when we come up with them.

## Patch Notes of Current Build
---

### 5/22/2016 Version 0.361 Notes:



### List of changes in new build: Version 0.48 5/22/2016

List of changes in new build:

Ton of stuff changed.

*More fixes added than I can count!

*Huge graphical overhaul of the UI
*All aspects on X's movement finished (I think)
^Drunk and Uniform shot movement now added. Some aspects of this might go a little crazy, but it's a bunch of fun :)


Known Bugs:
* There is still a slight problem with random stages where you get credit for beating the stage you ended up playing instead of the stage you had selected from the stage select.
* 
* There is a potential problem with starting health.  Not quite sure what it is, but it seems to be a more rare occurrence if anything.  Still be careful with it and password up.

If you find any glitches or something wrong, please leave a comment :D
