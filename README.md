## About
---

This will be a lengthy journey I'm sure.  With each update I'll list what has been fixed and also known issues going forward with patches.  Any checkboxes or radio buttons that have blacked out text will not be useable in any form and can't be clicked on.  These represent ideas we have but are not yet implemented in the actual program at this time.  They also don't represent everything we want to do for the randomizer just all ideas we have at the moment.  More will be added / implemented when we come up with them.

## Patch Notes of Current Build
---



### List of changes in new build: Version 0.69 6/27/2017

First update in a while and a big one at that!


Notes:
* Various bug fixes including health problems and generating multiple seeds at once
* Randomized Boss Rooms - I am halfway done implementing this, but this should be enough to tide you all over until
                          I finish making the rest.  There are 5 variants of every boss room in the 8 maverick stages 
                          minus Eagle (coming soon!).  
* Dr. Light Capsules - The Doctor Light capsules are now able to be shuffled.  They will be in their respective spots but what
                       they give you will be completely random minus hadouken.

Known Bugs:
* There is still a slight problem with random stages where you get credit for beating the stage you ended up playing instead of the stage you had selected from the stage select.
* There is a problem using both Random Mavs and Random Health / I-Frames.  


If you find any glitches or something wrong, please leave a comment :D
